### About the Experiment 

Objective of designing registers:

1. to understand the shifting of data
2. to examine the behavior of different modes of data input and data output(serial-in serial-out, serial-in parallel-out, parallel-in serial out,parallel-in parallel-out)
3. to make use of shift register in data transfer
developing skills in the designing and testing of sequential logic circuits
4. developing skills in analysing timing signals

Objective of designing counters:

1. understanding the concept of counting upto certain limiting value and returning back to the start state from final state
2. understanding the generation of timing sequences to control operations in a digital system
3. developing skills in the design and testing of counters for given timing sequences
4. developing skills in generating timing signals
