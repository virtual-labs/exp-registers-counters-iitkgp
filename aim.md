### Objective of Designing Registers:

1. To understand the shifting of data
2. To examine the behavior of different modes of data input and data output(serial-in serial-out, serial-in parallel-out, parallel-in serial out,parallel-in parallel-out)
3. To make use of shift register in data transfer
4. Developing skills in the designing and testing of sequential logic circuits
5. Developing skills in analysing timing signals

### Objective of Designing Counters:

1. Understanding the concept of counting upto certain limiting value and returning back to the start state from final state
2. Understanding the generation of timing sequences to control operations in a digital system
3. Developing skills in the design and testing of counters for given timing sequences
4. Developing skills in generating timing signals
